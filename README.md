## Configuration

There are three main env vars that configure emailambda:

| Name         | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BASIC_AUTH   | The value that the http authorization header is expected to have. This value is very important because it secures your lambda from being called by evil h√§ggerbois. |
| GMAIL_TOKEN  | The gmail token generated via gmail-token (find it in the 4thel00z/emaild github repository) encoded as a base64 string                                             |
| GMAIL_CONFIG | The credentials.json file that you have generate followed my smartboi tutorial (also in the 4thel00z/emaild github repository) encoded as a base64 string           |

You can use the netlify cli to set them:

```shell
netlify env:set GMAIL_TOKEN=$GMAIL_TOKEN
netlify env:set GMAIL_CONFIG=$GMAIL_CONFIG
netlify env:set BASIC_AUTH=$BASIC_AUTH
```

Note: The netlify cli can be installed as follows: `npm install -g netlify-cli`.

Alternatively you can set this when you press on the deploy button or later in the settings when you have deployed the lambda.
